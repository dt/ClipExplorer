Generates a storyboard from a video file which allows quickly viewing larger frames and/or
 playing of individual video segments.

Running "script/process.sh <path/to/video_file>" should generate a folder "output" which
 contains a webpage and supporting files. A browser pointed at the index.html (either 
 locally or served via a webserver) file should take care of the rest.

Example:
	wget <video URL>
	./scripts/process.sh <filename>
	firefox output/index.html

Dependencies:
	ffmpeg
	Webbrowser with HTML5 video & webm codec support

Notes:
	It doesn't work on iPhone/iPad/Safari/IE
		Switch format to x264 instead of webm in script/process.sh. 

	Frames are squished/streched
		An aspect-ratio preserving resize (using -vf "scale=-1:700") requires a newer
		version of ffmpeg, so I'm using a predetermined size. The third argument to
		script/process.sh overrides the default value ("ntsc").

	Too many/too few frames
		The second argument to script/process sets the frame rate. Default is .2 fps, so a 
		frame every 5s.
	
	Video plays locally, not from web
		If video playback works locally but not when the "output" directory is served from
		a webserver, you probably need to enable the correct mimetype (a .htaccess file was
		included to do this for you, but your webserver may not be using it). Either allow
		htaccess overrides, or copy the AddType from htaccess to your apache config.
